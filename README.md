# 🏥 DecentraMed: Medical Records on Blockchain

## 📘 Project Description
DecentraMed is a decentralized medical record management system built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It enables **patients and doctors** to securely store, access, and share medical records without relying on centralized systems.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a **trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof healthcare data ecosystem**, empowering patients with full control over their medical history while ensuring privacy and interoperability across healthcare providers.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Decentralized Storage:** Medical records are stored securely on-chain, ensuring immutability and integrity.  
- **Doctor Authorization:** Only verified doctors can add or modify medical records.  
- **Patient-Centric Access:** Patients can view their complete medical history anytime.  
- **Event Logging:** Every record addition and doctor authorization is logged for transparency.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with **IPFS** for large file (e.g., scan reports) storage.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** for private record verification.  
- **Multi-chain support** for cross-network interoperability.  
- **DApp Interface** for easy patient-doctor interactions.  
- Integration with **wearable health devices** for real-time data updates.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- Solidity (Smart Contract Development)
- Truffle / Hardhat (Development Framework)
- Ethereum Blockchain
- MetaMask (Wallet Integration)
- IPFS (Future integration)
